# Bitcoin Holdings of US Congress Members
Based upon public financial disclosures, we can know which politicians in Congress actually have skin in the game. Because searching through financial disclosures can be a time intensive process, this project's goal is to crowdsource the work.

NOTE: many politicians have yet to be researched; if you have some spare time, I encourage you to look up a few and contribute to this project with a pull request.

How to find financial disclosures: [US House](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/PublicDisclosure/FinancialDisclosure) [US Senate](https://efdsearch.senate.gov/search/) [US Executive Branch](https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf).
